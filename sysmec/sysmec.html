      My role in this project was to develop user interfaces to monitor data in real time.
      There were trenches located in another region, which had sensors to keep track of temperatures,
      battery levels and connectivity, delivering this information using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
      This data was processed and presented to the user in two interfaces, one as a summary for all trenches,
      and another one as a detailed view of each one.

        Here we can watch the end result:

        The user logs in and is presented with an interface of all the trenches with summarized data, for example,
        the last checked temperature. Here they can select any trench for a detailed view, where there is historic
        data on temperature and battery levels whitin a date range. An export button is provided to save the chart
        as-is with all the requested information.
