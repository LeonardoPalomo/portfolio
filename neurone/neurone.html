        This was a work done for my undergraduate thesis. There is a project in charge 
        of studying online inquiry competences on elementary and middle school students,
        where there are multiple tools along various platforms to achieve this goal,
        but there was a problem: How do we let the users know about these?
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution was to create a sorts of hub, a platform that can (in a gamified way)
        handle all the tools of the project in a single place, so the user can experience
        all of them without the hassle of dealing with each one individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rapid Application Development was used as a development approach, creating mockups
        using Figma, discussing them with a client and the development team, and implementing
        said mockups with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS).
      </p>
      <p>
        On the testing side, Karma and Jasmine where used, there was code coverage, Nielsen
        Heuristics and acceptance tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the final result at the time:

        The user logs in and is presented with a gamified interface, where they can select stages
        grouped by themes (built by admins beforehand). Each stage has a type and it plays different
        according to it, on this example, the stage type is of "trivia", so the user has to answer
        questions using the tools provided, while on the background data is collected for online
        inquiry competences studies.
